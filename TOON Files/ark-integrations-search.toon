      cross_reference: Check if multiple sources agree
      consensus:
        strong: 3+ authoritative sources agree → High confidence
        moderate: 2 sources agree, 1 differs → Medium confidence, note variance
        weak: Sources contradict → Low confidence, present multiple viewpoints
      example:
        query: React 18 release date
        result_1: react.dev says March 29, 2022
        result_2: GitHub release page says March 29, 2022
        result_3: Wikipedia says March 2022
        consensus: Strong - Multiple authoritative sources agree on March 29, 2022
        confidence: Very high (95%+)
  synthesis:
    extract_key_facts:
      what_to_extract:
        - Specific dates
        - Numerical data (salaries, percentages, counts)
        - Direct quotes from authoritative sources
        - Trends and patterns
        - Consensus viewpoints
      citation_format:
        inline: According to [Source], [fact]
        detailed: [Fact]. Source: [Source name] ([URL]), accessed [date]
        example: React 18 was released on March 29, 2022 (Source: React official blog)
    summarize_findings:
      structure:
        headline: One-sentence summary of finding
        details: 2-3 supporting facts
        source: Where information came from
        confidence: How certain we are
        recency: How current the data is
      example:
        headline: Senior DevOps Engineers in Austin earn $130k-$165k base salary (2024)
        details:
          - Glassdoor reports $135k median (1,234 salaries reported)
          - Levels.fyi shows $130k-$165k range for 5-8 years experience
          - Indeed reports similar range with $142k average
        source: Glassdoor, Levels.fyi, Indeed (checked January 2025)
        confidence: High - multiple sources agree
        recency: Current (data from Q4 2024)
    handle_conflicting_info:
      acknowledge_disagreement: Don't hide conflicts - present them transparently
      example:
        query: Impact of AI on recruiting jobs
        finding_1: LinkedIn report: AI will augment recruiters, not replace them
        finding_2: Forbes article: 30% of recruiting jobs at risk from AI automation
        synthesis: Views are mixed:
- **Optimistic view:** AI will augment recruiters, handling admin work while humans focus on relationship-building (LinkedIn report)
- **Cautious view:** 30% of recruiting jobs may be automated, particularly high-volume screening roles (Forbes)
- **My take:** Reality likely in between - AI will change recruiting significantly, eliminate some roles, transform others, create new ones. Recruiters who adopt AI will have advantage.
        confidence: Medium - conflicting expert opinions, outcome depends on factors (adoption rate, regulation, etc.)

    steps:
      - Formulate precise query
      - Execute search
      - Check top 3 results
      - If consensus, return answer with source

    example: User claims React 18 in 2021 → Search 'React 18 release date' → Find March 2022 → Flag error
  comprehensive_research:
    purpose: Gather in-depth information (e.g., market analysis)
    steps:
      - Break down into specific questions
      - Execute multiple targeted searches
      - Gather data from diverse sources
      - Cross-reference and validate
      - Synthesize into cohesive report

      proactive_updates: If major news, proactively inform users
    example: Monitor Greenhouse API for changes → Alert users if breaking changes announced
caching_strategy:
  purpose: Reduce redundant searches, improve speed, lower costs
  what_to_cache:
    technology_facts:
      example: React 18 release date
      ttl: 90 days (unlikely to change)
      invalidation: Manual only
    salary_data:
      example: DevOps salary in Austin
      ttl: 7 days (changes slowly)
      invalidation: Time-based or manual refresh
    company_info:
      example: Company X employee count
      ttl: 30 days (moderate change rate)
      invalidation: Time-based
    market_trends:
      example: AI hiring demand
      ttl: 7-14 days (changes quarterly but articles don't)
      invalidation: Time-based
    api_documentation:

      step_1: Check cache first
      step_2: If found and not expired, return cached result
      step_3: If expired or missing, execute search
      step_4: Store new result in cache
      step_5: Return result
    update_pattern:
      write_through: Update cache immediately when new data fetched
      write_back: Batch cache updates for efficiency
      invalidation: Remove expired entries daily
    freshness_indicator:
      show_age: Let user know if using cached data
      example: 'Based on data cached 3 hours ago. Click to refresh for latest.'
      auto_refresh_critical: For time-sensitive queries, always fetch fresh
